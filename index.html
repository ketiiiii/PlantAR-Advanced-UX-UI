              I am very happy with my plants, they were excellently packaged and arrived beautiful and fresh. PlantAR' service is also excellent. When I had a question, I was helped immediately. And the fact that I can see how would they look like? That is a huge plus!

              A really good experience. Ordering was easy, and delivery was excellent. We had some specific
delivery requirements which were fully met and everything was hustle free. From our experience we
certainlv recommend PlantAR.

             I bought two baby plants and a bag of seed. It arrived quickly and plants were packed nicely. One of the plants had a bit of issue but they immediately sent me the replacement. They provide nice products and service. I would recommend this shop to my friends.

         Everything was nicely wrapped up with a heat pack. Never thought I would buy plants online, but there were these cute little Baby plants and I couldn't avoid buying them and gave it a shot. The AR is just incredible.
I wasn't dissapointed when they came and now I am always buying there.
